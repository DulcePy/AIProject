        In the hush of morning light, <br />
        Dreams take wing and hearts feel right. <br />
        Whispers float on skies so blue, <br />
        Promising hopes both old and new. <br />
        Steps we take, though small they seem, <br />
        Build the path to every dream. <br />
        So hold on tight, be brave, be true - <br />
        The world awaits the best of you. <br />
